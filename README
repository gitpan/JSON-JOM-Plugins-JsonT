NAME
    JSON::JOM::Plugins::JsonT - transform a JOM structure with JsonT

DESCRIPTION
    This JOM plugin adds the following method to JOM objects and arrays:

    *   "transform($jsont)" - transforms the node using JsonT, returning a
        string.

    *   "transform_tojom($jsont)" - as "transform", but parses the result as
        JSON.

    *   "transform_replace($jsont)" - as "transform_tojom", and replaces the
        node in its parent structure.

    "transform_replace" cannot be called on root nodes.
